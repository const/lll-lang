  <p>
  This project contains prototype of an experimental low level language.
  The language has the following goals:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>It should target LLVM</li>
   <li>It shoudl be low-level enough to represent any effect possible on LLVM</li>
   <li>It should allow inline LLVM instructions</li>
   <li>It should be high-level enough to be usable</li>
   <li>The definition should be layered and modular</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The language is targeted for the following tasks:
  <ul>
   <li>It should be possible and easy to implement a good precise garbage collector in it.</li>
   <li>It should be possible and easy to have a precise GC subruntime in it (like managed C++).</li>
   <li>It should be possible and easy to write ETL parser in it (depends on GC).</li>
   <li>It should be possible and easy to write a minimal self-hosting compiler (depends on GC).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The intitial bootstrap compiler will be in Scala and it will use ETL parser.
  <p>The sources of inspiration:
  <ul>
   <li>BitC</li>
   <li>Managed C++</li>
   <li>LLVM</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Project priority:
  <ul>
   <li>Very Low (I will work on the project only when I will have an interesting idea).</li>
  </ul>
